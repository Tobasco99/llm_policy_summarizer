Specifically, manufacturers are responsible for ensuring that vehicles comply with specific safety standards and technical requirements. The document also mandates the inclusion of advanced vehicle systems such as event data recorders, intelligent speed assistance, and driver drowsiness and distraction warning systems, as well as provisions for tyre pressure monitoring systems and the environmental performance of tyres. These systems are designed to operate effectively without compromising user privacy or safety, ensuring that data is used solely for safety analysis and is protected against misuse. Additionally, vehicles must be accessible and safe for all users, including vulnerable road users and those with reduced mobility, with features designed to enhance visibility and safety. Advanced emergency braking and lane-keeping systems must be non-deactivatable by the driver and should operate normally upon vehicle start.The policy document establishes comprehensive guidelines for the type-approval of hydrogen-powered and automated vehicles, detailing uniform procedures and technical specifications. These specifications encompass material compatibility, fueling receptacles, and advanced vehicle systems such as event data recorders, driver availability monitoring systems, and data exchange for vehicle platooning. It mandates vehicle manufacturers to ensure new vehicles meet safety and environmental standards, incorporating systems like intelligent speed assistance and tyre pressure monitoring to enhance safety and compliance. The document highlights the roles of the European Parliament, the Council, and the Commission in the legislative process, particularly in adopting and potentially revoking delegated acts. Additionally, it maintains that existing EU type-approvals will remain valid unless modified by new requirements and allows Member States to permit registration of non-compliant vehicles until specified dates.
